# New Input System Binding Actions for PlayMaker

### Installation
* Open the cloned repo with Unity to check for the examples (Examples can be found in: `Assets/PlayMaker Custom Actions/Examples`).
* or Copy `Assets/PlayMaker Custom Actions` and `Assets\PlayMaker Custom Templates` folder into your Unity project.

Please make sure the `Input System` package is also imported to the Unity project.

I've only tested this on Unity 2021.3.28 and Input System 1.6.3, Rebind actions should work with Keyboard, Gamepad and Mouse (although I've only tested with Keyboard and 360 Compatible Gamepad).
